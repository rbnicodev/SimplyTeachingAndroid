### Android - Developing

##### An application for teacher notes management. 

In it, the teacher can log in and access the list of students that have been assigned to him.

By clicking on a student's card, he will be able to access all his data and the notes he has been writing about him. He will also be able to add more notes.



The application is under development, so at this time it only has:

- Login screen (Developing)
- ~~Student list screen~~
- ~~Student detail screen~~
